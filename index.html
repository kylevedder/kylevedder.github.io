<p>Hi, my name is Kyle Vedder and I am a freshman at UMass Amherst. I like to code and learn new things. Check out my list of some of the projects that I made. If you would like to know more about me, you can read my <a href="http://people.umass.edu/kvedder/resume">resume</a> or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:kvedder@umass.edu">kvedder@umass.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a short list of some of the cool projects I've created:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Project</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/cisco-assignment">cisco-assignment</a></td>
<td align="left">This was a programming challenge from Cisco-Startup designed to test my ability to write production quality code in a time-boxed environment while learning new technologies. I am very pleased with how this project turned out and it also introduced me to Spring Boot/Web/MVC, frameworks which I now love to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/PhysicsEngine">physics-engine</a></td>
<td align="left">This is a 2D physics engine I wrote for use in several of the other games I created as well as for use in a robot simulator I developed to test code. I learned a lot about how game engines work and about the benefits and shortcomings of different collision detection methods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatClient">KChatClient</a></td>
<td align="left">This is a chat client I wrote while learning about socket programming and multi-threading. This was my first foray into the world of multi-threaded design and I learned a lot of new design patterns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatServer">KChatServer</a></td>
<td align="left">This is the server counterpart to the above mentioned <a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatClient">KChatClient</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/EmailTrackerBackEnd">EmailTrackerBackend</a></td>
<td align="left">This is a service for tracking views on emails via images. This service provides a 1x1 white image to embed into emails that is fetched every time the email is loaded. When fetching the image, the request includes a unique ID which will increment a view counter in a database. This view counter can then be read through a GET request to the counter endpoint. I learned a lot about working with databases without and ORM and implementing RESTful APIs through this project. I also learned that without any framework to take care of the boilerplate, there is a lot of code to implement such a simple task.</td>
