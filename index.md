# I'm Kyle Vedder

<img src="img/me_dog.png" width="200" />

In 20 years I want there to be robots that can effectively provide a full range of quality care to the elderly. The US is on the verge of a [large retirement of baby boomers](img/static/usa_age_demo.png) and [China faces a deeply troubling demographic cliff in 20 years](img/static/china_age_demo.png), motivating the need for new methods of automated, high quality elder care not reliant upon human labor.

## Research

I am a PhD student at Penn under [Eric Eaton](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/) in the [Lifelong Machine Learning Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/labs/lifelong-machine-learning). Motivated by my goal of developing elder care robots, my research interests lie in the intersection of:

 - [Mobile robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7WW2cu1h7c)
 - [Vision-based object detection](publications/sparse_point_pillars_snn_workshop.pdf)
 - Self-supervised continual learning

In my undergrad at UMass Amherst I did research under [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/) in the [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Lab](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/). My research was in:

 - [Single-Agent Path Finding (SAPF)](http://vedder.io/publications/ScaffoldsLaneVedderBiswasPlanRob2017.pdf) for sampling based planners
 - [Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)](http://vedder.io/publications/expanding_astar_aij.pdf) for efficient first solution generation
 - [Core infrastructure](http://vedder.io/publications/MinutebotsRoboCupTDP2017.pdf) and [low level safety system](http://vedder.io/publications/MinutebotsRoboCupTDP2018.pdf) of our [RoboCup Small Size League team](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/minutebots.html)
