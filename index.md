# I'm Kyle Vedder

In 20 years I want there to be robots that can effectively automate the mechanical aspects of high-quality elder care (e.g. fetching objects, changing sheets, cleaning the room). The US is on the verge of a [large retirement of baby boomers](img/static/usa_age_demo.png) and [China faces a deeply troubling demographic cliff in 20 years](img/static/china_age_demo.png), motivating the need for new, more scalable and cost-effective methods of providing high-quality elder care that does not compromise on outcomes for patients.

## Background

I am a CS PhD [candidate](img/static/candidate.png) at Penn under [Eric Eaton](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/) in the [Lifelong Machine Learning group](https://lifelong-ml.github.io/) of [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). Motivated by my goal of developing elder care robots, my research interests lie in the intersection of:

 - [Mobile robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q4LCoJDOyY&t=2284s)
 - [Vision-based object detection](publications/sparse_point_pillars_iros_2022.pdf)
 - Self-supervised/unsupervised continual learning

During my undergrad in CS at UMass Amherst I did research under [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/) in the [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Lab](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/). My research was in:

 - [Single-Agent Path Finding (SAPF)](http://vedder.io/publications/ScaffoldsLaneVedderBiswasPlanRob2017.pdf) for sampling based planners
 - [Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)](http://vedder.io/publications/expanding_astar_aij.pdf) for efficient first solution generation
 - [Core infrastructure](http://vedder.io/publications/MinutebotsRoboCupTDP2017.pdf) and [low level safety system](http://vedder.io/publications/MinutebotsRoboCupTDP2018.pdf) of our [RoboCup Small Size League team](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/minutebots.html)

 I have also done a number of industry internships; I have interned twice at Unidesk (a startup since aquired by Citrix), twice at Google, and once at Amazon's R&D lab, Lab126 (where I worked on their home robot [Astro](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/meet-astro-a-home-robot-unlike-any-other)).
