**I am graduating with my CS PhD from Penn in May 2025, and I am on the job market for an industry Research Scientist position, either at a major AI lab or at a robotics startup, with the goal of working towards an embodied AI system that can perform at or above human level in a variety of domestic and industrial labor tasks.**

<!-- My career goal is to build embodied AI system that can perform at or above human level in a variety of domestic and industrial labor tasks. I chose to do a PhD to focus on the 3D perception and world modeling aspect of this problem, as I believe having the right representation is a critical factor in learning robust, generalizable policies. My PhD research has focused on the problem of Scene Flow, which I believe encapsulates the critical ability to understand the dynamics of the 3D world. -->

## Research Interests

STATEMENT_OF_PURPOSE

## Academic Background

I am a CS PhD [candidate](img/static/candidate.png) at Penn under [Eric Eaton](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/) and [Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/) in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). My current line of work is focused on Scene Flow with the general goal of building flexible, scalable systems that do not require human annotations.

Representative projects include:

 - [ZeroFlow: Scalable Scene Flow via Distillation](./zeroflow.html)
   - Distill an expensive optimization method into a feed-forward network and data scale it to state-of-the-art performance
 - [_I Can't Believe It's Not Scene Flow!_](./trackflow.html)
    - Standard benchmarks were systematically broken, hiding the failure of all methods to describe small object motion; we proposed a new metric and a simple baseline that was state-of-the-art
  - [Argoverse 2 2024 Scene Flow Challenge](https://www.argoverse.org/sceneflow)
    - Hosted a challenge to push the field to close the gap between prior art and a qualitative notion of reasonable flow quality
 
**For a narrative overview of how my PhD research fits together, see [_Overview of my PhD Research_](./overview_of_my_phd.html).**


## Industry / Engineering Background

 I have done many industry internships:

  - NVIDIA as a research intern under [Zhiding Yu](https://chrisding.github.io/)
  - ArgoAI as a research intern under [James Hays](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/) 
  - Amazon Lab126 as a perception intern on their home robot, [Astro](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/meet-astro-a-home-robot-unlike-any-other)
  - Google as a software engineering intern on adwords and ads quality
  - Unidesk (a startup since aquired by Citrix)

I also have significant experience doing high-precision full stack robotics. In undergrad, I lead the greenfield development of [AMRL](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/)'s [Robocup Small Size League control stack](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/minutebots.html) and did research in [multi-agent path planning](./xstar.html).


<!-- During my undergrad in CS at UMass Amherst I did research under [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/) in the . My research was in:

 - [Single-Agent Path Finding (SAPF)](http://vedder.io/publications/ScaffoldsLaneVedderBiswasPlanRob2017.pdf) for sampling based planners
 - [Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)](./xstar.html) for efficient first solution generation
 - [Core infrastructure](http://vedder.io/publications/MinutebotsRoboCupTDP2017.pdf) and [low level safety system](http://vedder.io/publications/MinutebotsRoboCupTDP2018.pdf) of our [RoboCup Small Size League team](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/minutebots.html)
