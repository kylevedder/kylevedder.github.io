    <!-- Hello!

         In case you're wondering, this is a joke. I actually like the government.
         I, however, also like the dystopian cyberpunk aestetic, and part of that
         is oppressive governments. Please realize that this
         does not in any way, shape, or form, indicate a dislike for government agencies.
         In fact, depending on the agency, I think I'd quite enjoy working for one.

         As far as the Illuminati symbolism is concerned, I also think that the aestetic
         and mistique surrounding them are cool. Once again, I am not pretending to be
         part of the Illuminati or anything of that sort; I am just trying to make cool
         eastereggs for when somebody (probably nobody) comes.

         As far as the anti-captialism messaging is concerned, once again I like the aestetic
         but actually very much like capitalism as a system. I do not believe that there is another
         system that works in practice nearly as well as captialism.

         Sorry for (probably) scaring you.
         
         Have a nice day!
