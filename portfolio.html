            <p>
                These are just a few of the many projects I have worked on. To see the others or what I am currently up to, check out <a href="https://github.com/kylevedder">my GitHub page</a>.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/JChains">JChains</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is a Markov Chain library for Java, featuring a text tokenizer and generator.
                It supports a wide range of features, from extensible tokenization to arbitrary
                lookback to lazy assessment of the Markov Chain. This was my first experience
                developing a library as well as working with Markov Chains.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/cisco-assignment">Cisco Assignment</a></h2>
            <p>
                This was a programming challenge from Cisco足Startup designed to test my
                ability to write production quality code in a time足boxed environment while
                learning new technologies. I am very pleased with how this project turned out
                and it also introduced me to Spring Boot/Web/MVC, frameworks which I now
                love to use.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/physics-engine">Physics Engine</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is a 2D physics engine I wrote for use in several of the other games I created
                as well as for use in a robot simulator I developed to test code. I learned a lot
                about how game engines work and about the benefits and shortcomings of
                different collision detection methods.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatClient">KChat Client</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is a chat client I wrote while learning about socket programming and multi足
                threading. This was my first foray into the world of multi足threaded design and I
                learned a lot of new design patterns.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatServer">KChat Server</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is the server counterpart to the above mentioned <a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatClient">KChat Client</a>.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/EmailTrackerBackEnd">Email Tracker Backend</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is a service for tracking views on emails via images. This service provides a
                1x1 white image to embed into emails that is fetched every time the email is
                loaded. When fetching the image, the request includes a unique ID which will
                increment a view counter in a database. This view counter can then be read
                through a GET request to the counter endpoint. I learned a lot about working
                with databases without an ORM and implementing RESTful APIs through this
                project. I also learned that without any framework to take care of the boilerplate,
                there is a lot of code to implement such a simple task.
