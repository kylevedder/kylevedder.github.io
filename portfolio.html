      <h1 class="demo-section-title">Portfolio</h1>

       <p>
                These are just a few of the many projects I have worked on. To see the others or what I am currently up to, check out <a href="https://github.com/kylevedder">my GitHub page</a>.
      </p>

      <h1 class="demo-panel-title"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/cisco-assignment">Cisco Assignment</a></h1>
      <p>
        This was a programming challenge from Cisco足Startup designed to test my
ability to write production quality code in a time足boxed environment while
learning new technologies. I am very pleased with how this project turned out
and it also introduced me to Spring Boot/Web/MVC, frameworks which I now
love to use.
      </p>
    <h1 class="demo-panel-title"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/physics-engine">Physics Engine</a></h1>
      <p>
        This is a 2D physics engine I wrote for use in several of the other games I created
as well as for use in a robot simulator I developed to test code. I learned a lot
about how game engines work and about the benefits and shortcomings of
different collision detection methods.
      </p>
<h1 class="demo-panel-title"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatClient">KChat Client</a></h1>
      <p>
        This is a chat client I wrote while learning about socket programming and multi足
threading. This was my first foray into the world of multi足threaded design and I
learned a lot of new design patterns.
      </p>
      <h1 class="demo-panel-title"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatServer">KChat Server</a></h1>
      <p>
        This is the server counterpart to the above mentioned <a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/KChatClient">KChat Client</a>.
      </p>
      <h1 class="demo-panel-title"><a href="https://github.com/kylevedder/EmailTrackerBackEnd">Email Tracker Backend</a></h1>
      <p>
        This is a service for tracking views on emails via images. This service provides a
1x1 white image to embed into emails that is fetched every time the email is
loaded. When fetching the image, the request includes a unique ID which will
increment a view counter in a database. This view counter can then be read
through a GET request to the counter endpoint. I learned a lot about working
with databases without an ORM and implementing RESTful APIs through this
project. I also learned that without any framework to take care of the boilerplate,
there is a lot of code to implement such a simple task.
