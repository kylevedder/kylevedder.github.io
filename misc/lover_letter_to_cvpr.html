<p><img src="../img/static/love_letter_to_cvpr.png" class="centered" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"></p>
<p>I finished my reviews for CVPR 2026 over the weekend, and it caused
me to reflect on how special the CVPR community has been. Despite not
having authored a paper at CVPR (yet, fingers crossed on our current
submission!), I’ve gone every year since 2023 to host or participate in
workshops, and it feels like my home conference. It’s very different
from the venues I have published in (mostly ICLR and ECCV), which I
attribute to the type of attendees and the academic stewardship of its
industrial and corporate participants.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, between AV consolidation and the end of serious
publishing by frontier labs, these corporate stewards appear to have
recently died off. I hope a new wave of companies who view academia as
an ideas engine and not as just a hiring pool emerge as new stewards who
preserve CVPR’s special culture.</p>
<h2 id="a-trip-down-memory-lane">A trip down memory lane</h2>
<p>I still remember my first CVPR in 2023. It was hosted in the
Vancouver convention center, featuring beautiful views of English Bay
and the sights and sounds of the seaplane tours taking off and landing
nearby. I was staying in a hotel with <a
href="http://ishan.khatri.io/">Ishan Khatri</a>, my longtime friend and
collaborator, and we were on the hunt for inspiration for our next paper
— we had submitted <a href="http://vedder.io/zeroflow">ZeroFlow</a> to
the Argoverse Scene Flow Challenge at the Workshop on Autonomous
Driving, where it won an award, but we didn’t really know where we were
going to take this line of research next. Looking at the list of
workshops, Ishan saw <a
href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tT2TC-UAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Laura
Leal-Taixe</a>, a TUM professor who was previously affiliated with Argo
AI (our previous employer), was scheduled to present at <a
href="https://taodataset.org/workshop/cvpr23/index.html">a workshop on
tracking</a>. We walked in just before <a
href="https://adamharley.com/">Adam Harley</a> gave his presentation on
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04153">Particle Tracking (PIPs)</a>.
After Adam’s presentation was over, Ishan and I realized there were deep
connections between the problems of particle tracking and scene flow —
particle tracking is long horizon and sparse, while scene flow is short
horizon and dense, but there lies a synthesis of the two in dense, long
horizon tracking. This had a big impact on our research agenda. In a
moment of excitement after the workshop coffee break, we sketched out
the beginnings of a master plan that ultimately became the rest of my
thesis and beyond. For example, <a
href="https://vedder.io/eulerflow">EulerFlow</a> followed directly from
this, which poses a dense, long horizon optimization problem and
consequently has particle tracking in 3D fall out for free.</p>
<p>As anyone who’s been to a conference knows, the conference isn’t just
about posters and workshops — there’s also evening company and
university after parties. Few things in life are more fun than throwing
all your friends in a giant group chat to share party locations and
bootleg screenshots of personal invites, hoping to make it past the
door. The CVPR 2023 Snapchat party was hosted at a swanky bar; running
the door was a very angry but very stupid bouncer. Distracted by yelling
“no invite, no entry” at the rest of the line, he did not catch on that
every member of our group had shown him the exact same invite on the
exact same bright pink iPhone that we handed down the line. Inside, I
got to try the first public prototype of the Snapchat Spectacles AR
glasses, and spend the better part of an hour talking to one of the SLAM
engineers about the ins and outs of getting robust SLAM to run on a tiny
CPU inside the glasses.</p>
<p>At the CVPR 2024 Waymo party, we didn’t have an invite, but we
managed to convince another AV recruiter to help get us in and introduce
us to Drago, the head of Waymo Research, where we showed him the early
results of <a href="../img/static/eulerflow/bird.gif">EulerFlow doing
point tracking on a bird just from raw LiDAR data</a>. We tried to tell
him this was the future of scene flow, but he was deeply skeptical of
this claim. Afterwards, we ran into Adam Harley at the Apple party,
where we showed him the same results and credited his PIPs presentation
at the workshop the year prior as inspiration, and talked about his job
search and what he was working on next.</p>
<h2 id="in-it-for-the-love-of-the-game">In it for the love of the
game</h2>
<p>In these stories, the people involved all genuinely love research.
The atmosphere is collegial, focused on the science and thinking about
the big problems in computer vision, and I think an enormous amount of
credit for this should go to the industrial labs and companies that have
sponsored, published, and actively fostered the CVPR community. For
example, the Autonomous Vehicle companies were excellent at engaging
with academia — they released many datasets (NuScenes, Argoverse, Waymo
Open) and funded challenges to ensure the community remained valuable,
active participants in solving real computer vision problems, in
addition to publishing real state-of-the-art with frontier results.
Similarly, many of the vision teams in the industrial AI labs have
produced enormously impactful publications and artifacts; the <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643">Segment Anything</a> series, <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294">DINO</a> series, and <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07058">Ego4D</a> dataset from FAIR are
such incredibly valuable primitives that have fundamentally reshaped
modern CV. Despite requiring significant corporate resources to
construct these datasets and artifacts, the companies were very open
about what they were working on and where their challenges remained.</p>
<p>By comparison, I think ICLR, NeurIPS, and other large generic ML
conferences have lost this community culture — the vast majority of
papers are uninteresting variations of finetuning an LLM to do some
random task, everyone knows that all actual frontier work is being done
at labs that don’t publish anymore, and many of the attendees are
primarily in attendence to find a job or extract secrets to inform their
investment theses. The large tech companies still have corporate
parties, but they are just recruitment events, indistinguishable from
the parties hosted by the many HFT / prop trading firms trying to
convince ML talent to go work in finance.</p>
<h2 id="concern-for-the-future">Concern for the future</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I fear it’s currently a bit of an inevitability that
CVPR will go down this path. Google DeepMind and FAIR have ceased to be
serious publishing units, and Waymo and Motional’s research orgs have
collapsed as AV has solidified into a product. I fear this means the
good corporate stewardship that served as an important bridge between
industry and academia has been lost. In its place, I expect to see video
generation and world model companies with hyper-valuations (and
hyper-exectations) take over, and with them bring the secretive,
competitive, closed lab culture of generic ML conferences. Academic
participation in real problems will collapse, leaving behind a trail of
uninteresting finetuning papers and a fractured community.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong. I hope we see a new wave of companies invest in
academic stewardship to ensure CVPR continues to be the conference that
I know and love. I think the academic community is an excellent source
of genuinely interesting and useful ideas, and it’s in the long term
interest of companies to find ways to harness this ideas engine to make
breakthroughs on hard problems that would take far longer if tackled
only by secretive internal R&amp;D teams.</p>
<p>I will see you all in June at CVPR 2026, and let me know if you have
any exciting party invites!</p>
