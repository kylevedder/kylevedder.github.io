<body><p><em>Q:</em> Can we have autograder with public tests and private
tests? That will be much more helpful!</p>
<p><em>A:</em> No. This is not 121. This is not 187. This is 220. You
are expected to be able to write your own code and not just fill in the
blanks.</p>
<p>One of the overarching goals of this class is for you to learn how to
write programs in a real world environment.</p>
<p>In the real world, no one writes tests for you. If you do not meet
the spec for the work assigned to you, you will be laid off and replaced
with someone who can. Alternatively, your code may meet the spec’s
interface but fail in production. The company will do a postmortem, and
it will come out that you did not correctly test your code. You will be
laid off and replaced with someone who can.</p>
<p>I’m not being hyperbolic. Writing correct, self-tested code to a spec
is a required real world skill, and one which we are trying to teach you
here. We would much rather you get dinged a few points on an assignment
now than be unemployable in 3 years.</p>
<p>We will not give you an autograder, nor public tests. It’s explicitly
your job to write them yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
