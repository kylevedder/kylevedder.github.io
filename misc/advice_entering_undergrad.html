incoming Computer Science undergraduates</h1>
<p><em>This is copied verbatim from a email I sent to a student who was
preparing to enter their first year as a Computer Science student at
UMass Amherst and was looking for advice. Some of the names are specific
to UMass, but the advice is generally applicable. I have reproduced it
here in the hope that it will be useful to others.</em></p>
<h2 id="where-to-live">Where to live?</h2>
<p>Orchard Hill. Try to join the CS RAP (Residential Academic Program)
or if you’re Exploratory Track CS, there’s an Exploratory CS RAP.
Surrounding yourself with and befriending other motivated CS students
will motivate you and make you perform better.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-do-well-in-class">How to do well in class?</h2>
<p>Always go to class, sit in the front row, ask questions if you do not
understand. The professors appreciate that you care and are trying to
learn and will remember you for it. This goes doubly so if you
constantly associate with a group of people who act the same (see: Where
to live?).</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-outside-of-class">What should I do outside of
class?</h2>
<p>Do lots of projects. Build random things. Learn new languages. Play
with cool technologies. Apply the things you are learning to stupid
stuff you think would be fun to build. This will develop your skills and
provide projects you can put on GitHub and reference on your resume.</p>
<p>As part of this, participate in hackathons. HackUMass and HackHolyoke
are great venues because they’re close but they still have a wide array
of companies recruiting at them. The dirty little secret about
hackathons is they’re mostly about technical marketing; the ideas can be
outright stupid but the Secret Formula To Always Win™ is to have one
component you built yourself from scratch that has technical depth and
aggressively hype that component during your presentations.</p>
<h2
id="what-non-obvious-things-should-i-know-about-being-a-student">What
non-obvious things should I know about being a student?</h2>
<p>Your reputation matters tremendously. This doesn’t mean pretending
you know everything or asking questions just to seem smart; in fact, it
means the exact opposite. Professors, and the students that matter, can
delineate the genuine article from an imitation; if you focus on
constantly trying to grow and improve, your competence and expertise
will speak for themselves and you will be noticed. It is very common for
students to pursue the aesthetics of success without trying to attain
the competence and mastery that lead to success. This materially
manifests itself in a variety of ways, from lying on their resume to
abusing buzzwords to blaming the class/professor for their failures to
caring only about class grades rather than understanding the material
(by either outright cheating on homeworks or using materials like Chegg
to get the answer instead of figuring it out and learning).</p>
<p>This reputation matters because it gets you things. Professors talk
about the students they remember, and they remember three types of
students: really good students, really bad students, and the students
who went to all their lectures <em>and were engaged</em> (usually this
has strong overlap with the really good students). If you ask a
professor to do research with them, that professor will ask around about
you and, if you have a positive reputation, they’re almost certainly
going to agree. If you are an unknown quantity, there’s a much higher
chance they will turn you away. If you want to become an undergraduate
TA (you should), the program coordinators are students and having a
positive reputation will make it much easier to not only get selected,
but get selected for the class you want to TA.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-internships">How do I get internships?</h2>
<p>The first thing that matters is your resume. A lot of people use
templates online with a lot of color, bizzare formatting, and lots of
fluff, all in the name of “style”. The reality is it makes your resume
impossible to read. Here’s the resume I landed a Google internship with
my freshman year (Link: <a
href="http://vedder.io/misc/KyleVedderResumeHighSchool.pdf">http://vedder.io/misc/KyleVedderResumeHighSchool.pdf</a>).
Notice it’s simple (I did it in Google Docs), structured, and easy to
follow top to bottom. This will allow recruiters to better skim your
resume and be more likely to call you in for an interview.</p>
<p>If you have no prior internship experience, you’re going to struggle
to get an internship. You should go to things like career fairs, but
most medium to large companies there simply take your resume and deposit
it in a pile to be processed later. If you want to get that first summer
experience as a freshman, I recommend you target smaller companies and
do not volunteer the fact that you are a freshman. They are more likely
to remember your one on one interaction and they are typically more
willing to hire interns without prior experience.</p>
<p>Irrespective of your prior experience level, the key to actually
landing an internship is passing the technical interview. A lot of
people say “read Cracking the Coding Interview and grind LeetCode for a
million hours” but I think that’s myopic. I’ve done none of the above;
instead I did lots of projects (see: What should I do outside of class?)
and these taught me the same skills, but with the added benefit of
having actually built something real that I can put on my resume and
GitHub page. Note that this advice is in stark opposition to the
orthodoxy so there may be some merit in ignoring it if it doesn’t work
for you.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>A lot of people are obsessed with CS because they want to land a
software engineering job. They see the six figure salaries, they see the
high status startups, they see cool buzzwords like “deep learning” and
“neural networks” being added to tech products and they want a piece of
the action.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with wanting to do that. But that’s not
Computer Science. Software Engineering is a vocation that leverages
concepts from CS to build things. However, CS is the study and
development of these useful concepts. For example, consider Generalized
Additive Models (GAMs); this model was developed by computer scientists
to be interpretable and work well in practice without strong
assumptions, e.g. Gaussian noise in OLS. GAMs are now being used by
scientists to show that COVID’s transmission rate is stable to
increasing temperature above a certian threshold, but roughly linear
below that threshold<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (sadly, this suggests COVID will not
magically disappear this summer). Keep an open mind as to what you will
do after you graduate. Realize that, if you pay attention in class,
Computer Science equips you with skills far beyond how to code so you
can get a job getting people to click on ads or at a <del>Machine
Learning startup</del> buzzword factory burning VC money like it’s the
Papiermark.</p>
